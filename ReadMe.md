# Complete EntertainmentMp3 News/Blog API using NodeJS (Express), MongoDB with Swagger

This is the source code for Complete News/Blog API using NodeJS (Express), MongoDB with Swagger - Part 1 of my Complete MERN Stack journey on GIZ Schorlaship

In this repo, we develop the REST API with the following features:

1. Authentication and authorization using PassportJS and JWT
2. Model validations using express-validator
3. Data modeling and schema construction using Mongoose
4. Categories, stories, videos and comments CRUD and authorized or protected routes
5. Swagger documentation with authentication and image uploading using swagger-autogen
6. Emails sending, data pagination, rate limiting, and image uploading.
